# FlappyDemo

This game was made through the use of Brent Aureli's YouTube tutorial on an introduction to LibGDX and how to make FlappyBird. You can
find his channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO9JvZ75Usyzgd1puurLF6A

I continued from where Brent left off and added a few things of my own.
1. Game Over State
2. Scoreboard and scoring system
3. Bird upperbounded y coordinate
4. Comments and code readability
